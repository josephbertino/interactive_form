# js interactive_form

### Javascript project demonstrating an interactive form with regex input validation

Mockup of an event registration form, complete with T-shirt ordering, activity selecting, and credit card payment fields.
  * Built with customized, conditional behavior and interactivity
  * Validates user input and provides helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.

#### Activity Registration
(For the "Exceed Expectations" Task)

In order to prevent the user from registering for conflicting activities, the form dynamically enables/disables simultaneously-occurring activities from being selected based on the currently selected activities.

#### Form Validation
(For the "Exceed Expectations" Task)

The following fields provide instantaneous feedback to the user about the validity of their input:
* Name
* Email
* Activities Box
* Credit Card Number
* Credit Card Zip Code
* Credit Card CVV

#### Conditional Error Messages
(For the "Exceeds Expectations" Task)

The following fields provide conditional error messages on the validity of the user input:
* Name
 * If the name field is empty
 * If the name field only contains whitespace
* Email
 * If the email field is empty
 * If the email address is not properly formatted
